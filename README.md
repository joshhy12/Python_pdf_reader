##Document QA System

##Overview

The Document QA System is a Python-based application designed to read documents (including PDF files) and answer questions posed by the user based on the content of those documents. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to extract relevant information and provide accurate responses to user queries.

##Features

Document Parsing: Supports parsing of various document formats, including PDF files, to extract text content.
NLP Processing: Utilizes NLP libraries such as NLTK and spaCy for tasks like part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.
Question Processing: Processes user questions to identify keywords and relevant information for answering.
Answer Extraction: Implements techniques such as information retrieval and machine learning models to extract answers from the document text.
User Interface: Optional user interface for interacting with the system, providing an intuitive way for users to input documents and ask questions.
